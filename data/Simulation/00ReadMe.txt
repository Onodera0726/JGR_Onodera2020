This directory includes original outputs for simulation.

"1_First_Silumation.zip"
Original dataset used to get the profiles shown in Figure 6 are put here.
"2_Additional_Silumation.zip"
Original dataset used to get the rise times shown in Figure 7 and Figure 8 are put here.

File names correspond to the structure models and impact event.
For example, in the case of Model0_A14S12.Vz.sac,
i) simulation was conducted under the velocity structure Model 0 in table 2;
ii) simulated event is Apollo14 S-IVB impact observed at Station 12 Z component.
